# Project Details
## How do I complete this project?
Review the Online Resume [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.189245867.12280332.1465333852#!/projects/2962818615/rubric).

1. In this project you will store your resume data in four javaScript objects according to the schema given below. As is often the case when leveraging an API, the objects must follow the schema exactly. All properties must be present and have real or fake values. The names must match those in the schema (note that object and property names are case-sensitive). All property values should be of the data-type given for the property in the schema. For example if the data-type is given as an array, it is not acceptable to use a string as a value for that property.
2. Once you've created your javaScript objects, you will write the code needed to display all of the resume data contained within these objects in your resume.
3. All of the HTML code needed to build the resume is stored in **js/helper.js** variables. The variable names indicate their function. You will replace substrings in these variable string values such as **%data%** and **#** with the data in your javaScript objects, and append or prepend the formatted result to your resume in the appropriate location.
Legend:

    index.html: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
    js/helper.js: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
    js/resumeBuilder.js: Coded by me for resume liveliness.
    js/jQuery.js: The jQuery library.
    css/style.css: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.

Explored and utilized different JavaScript libraries to build my interactive resume and styled it effectively so that resume is responsive.
